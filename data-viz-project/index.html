  <h1>Prince William and Kate Middleton's "Cringeworthy" Caribbean Tour</h1>

  <p>At the start of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year in 2012, Jamaica's then new Prime Minister, Portia Simpson-Miller, announced the country's intention to become a republic. "I love the Queen; she is a beautiful lady," the politician said. "But I think time come." For whatever reasons, as the Queen marks her Platinum Jubilee a decade later, Jamaica has yet to get rid of her as head of state. But there can be no doubt that the past 10 years have seen conversations around the British monarchy's position on the world stage significantly shift. In November 2021, Barbados became the first country in almost 30 years to remove the Queen and replace her with a President. And discussions over apologies and reparations from Britain and other countries over slavery have intensified, with 2013 seeing the creation of the CARICOM Reparations Commission to establish the "moral, ethical and legal" case for reparations by governments of "all the former colonial powers."</p>

  <p>It was against this backdrop that Prince William and Kate jetted into the Caribbean to tour Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas for eight days. Before it even began, the trip faced questions about timing given events in Ukraine. Royal aides said they were keeping a close eye and may adjust their program accordingly, when asked about the decision to go ahead with the celebratory trip.</p>

  <blockquote>"...the small protest was just a glimpse of the controversy their trip would ultimately attract."</blockquote>

  <p>"The Duke and Duchess are very much looking forward to visiting the Caribbean region during the Platinum Jubilee year and having the opportunity to thank communities…for the support they have shown Her Majesty throughout her seventy-year reign," Kensington Palace said. Elsewhere, the visit was more blatantly described as a "charm offensive" to "shore up support" for the monarchy in the region.</p>

  <div class="sectionheader"><a name="Protests">Protests</a></div>

  <p>However, before the couple even touched down there were significant holes in the 'winning them over' narrative. "William and Kate in Tour Storm," was the Daily Mail headline the day the couple arrived. The story, followed up worldwide, centered on a protest from residents over their dispute with a charity William supports and the fact the trip organizers had not got permission to land the royal helicopter on their football field. A visit to the Akte'il Ha cacao farm in Indian Creek was hastily canceled and the royals appeared at a different chocolate farm, full of smiles. But it turned out that the small protest was just a glimpse of the controversy their trip would ultimately attract.</p>

  <p>As the Cambridges posted pictures and videos on their social media accounts of them diving in Belize's barrier reef alongside breezy messages with plane and flag emojis, a bigger debate about the visit was beginning to rage. Protestors outside the British High commission in Jamaica handed over a letter signed by a group of 100 prominent individuals from Jamaica's Advocates Network calling for an "apology and recognition of the need for atonement and reparations." The letter also said, "We see no reason to celebrate 70 years of the ascension of your grandmother to the British throne because her leadership, and that of her predecessors, have perpetuated the greatest human rights tragedy in the history of humankind."</p>

  <p>Protests during royal visits to the Caribbean are nothing new, but this tour felt like a turning point. For the first time, images of glamorous royals smiling in the sunshine while observing and sampling local life did not overshadow dissenting voices about monarchy and colonialism. There were many fantastic images and positive encounters, with the couple attracting frequent crowds and praise from those they spoke to. But it was the protests, not the pleasantries, that took center-stage. A tour designed to increase ties ended up becoming a catalyst for a brighter spotlight on those calling to sever them.</p>

  <div class="sectionheader"><a name="Issues">Unresolved Issues</a></div>

  <p>This was never more apparent than when the royal couple met Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness and his wife Juliet on their arrival into Kingston. As the cameras were rolling at the start of the meeting, the Prime Minister said clearly that the royals' presence allowed "unresolved" issues to be "put front and center," adding that Jamaica was "moving on."</p>

  <p>At that time, William said very little, at least not while the cameras were there. But later that night he made a long speech in which he most notably directly addressed the "appalling atrocity" of slavery. "I want to express my profound sorrow," he said. "Slavery was abhorrent, And it should never have happened."</p>

  </div>

  <p>But if the Prince, and those who had drafted and approved his speech, had thought that these words would earn him praise, they were mistaken. It was widely noted that his comments fell short of the apology requested. "This 'tone deaf' statement echoes the well-crafted words of his father. It does not rise to the level of the formal apology that we deserve," the same Advocates Network spearheading the protest over the visit told The Independent in a statement.
  </p>

  <p>As the tour progressed, it became increasingly clear that moments intended to show the royals as empathetic and in touch were sparking the totally opposite reaction. When William and Kate greeted cheering children by a football pitch who were standing behind a wire fence in Trench Town, the resulting imagery created a deeply uncomfortable look for the monarchy as it instantly went viral. And when they deliberately recreated the Queen and Prince Philip's journey on a Land Rover from decades ago, the wistful nod to a bygone era struck an odd tone in a country looking to move forward not back.</p>

  <blockquote>"But right from the beginning, something did feel different about this trip."</blockquote>

  <div class="sectionheader"><a name="Disaster">Disaster</a></div>

  <p>By the time the couple jetted out of Jamaica, the narrative that the trip was a disaster was well and truly entrenched. One Washington Post article headlined it as "cringeworthy." A journalist for the Daily Mail declared herself to be "dying of embarrassment." And a BBC royal correspondent traveling with the royals wrote of the "curiously disorganised" visit, commenting, "Times have changed. The Royal Family have in the past been pretty good at changing with them. But not on this tour.” As the couple emerged on Friday in The Bahamas to pouring rain, it was hard not to wonder whether even mother nature had decided to join in.</p>

  <iframe title="Does Jamaica want to become a Republic?" aria-label="Pie Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-9MnY3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9MnY3/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="563"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

  <p>The question of whether the Cambridges could have avoided such negative reactions if things had been done differently is an interesting one. There is no doubt that steering clear of the optics of certain images could have spared them significant criticism. But right from the beginning, something did feel different about this trip. When so many focused on what was in reality a small protest in Belize, it felt like there was a global recognition that these were the issues that should be amplified during a visit to Caribbean realms at this time.</p>

  <p>Whenever Buckingham Palace is asked about other countries retaining the British monarch as head of state they give a stock answer that this is "a matter for the people of [whatever country is in question]." While some might say that a charm offensive trip can only be viewed as an attempt retain the status quo, one only has to look at how the Queen responded to Barbados becoming a republic to see the grace with which the institution will let go. "On this significant occasion and your assumption of office as the first President of Barbados, I extend my congratulations to you and all Barbadians," the 95-year-old Queen said in a message as her son and heir was sent to represent her as she was removed from her position.</p>

  <p>This sentiment was reinforced by her grandson in his final speech before departing The Bahamas. "We support with pride and respect your decisions about your future. Relationships evolve. Friendship endures," the Prince said. If the tour had indeed been designed to secure the monarchy's future in the region, it had ended on an admission of defeat. But one senses that these may well be the words that William was the happiest to be able to deliver throughout the entire trip.</p>

  <p>Prince Charles's visit to Barbados last November saw him arrive in the country as its future head of state and leave with a completely changed status. In contrast, Prince William departs The Bahamas today on the same footing on which he arrived—as a Prince of the realm and its future king. Who knows when he and Kate will be back, but it appears increasingly likely that by the time he is, some realms in the Caribbean will have followed Barbados's lead to see through the process of changing their head of state. Jamaica has made their intentions very clear and, following the royal visit, Belize has also signaled its desire to do the same. Ten years ago the then Jamaican Prime Minister declared "time come." The biggest thing this trip has highlighted is the fact that now it really has.</p>
